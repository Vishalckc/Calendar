Identity Server
---------------

# CS555 Spring 2008
# Programming Assignment 2

## Description

Included is a basic tesh.sh with examples of how to run the code. The basic form is:
	
	java -classpath bin/ identity.client.IdClient localhost 5299 [--command]
	
The IdClient will default to the same default port of the server, 5299 which is on my port list.

To run the server use:

	java -classpath bin/ identity.server.IdentityServer

Where bin/ is the location of the packages.

To build project use
 
	ant build
or 

	ant clean
to clean the project.

The code is commented with javadoc. The basic structure is based on a pure server-client architecture.
There are no callbacks from the client and errors are reported by throwing new UserInfoExceptions.

The code for spinning of the checkpointing stuff works but is not very robust and I didn't
quite finish the bit for closing out nicely. But it does what it is supposed to do.
